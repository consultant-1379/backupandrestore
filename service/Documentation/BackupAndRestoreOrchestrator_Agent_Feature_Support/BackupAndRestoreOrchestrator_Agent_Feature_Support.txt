note: in the above table `TBD` indicates "To Be Done". In the event a feature is not required by an agent NA (Not Applicable) should be entered in the table.

=== Features

==== Full Backup
Basic backup that captures all data in the data management service

==== Full Restore
Basic restore that replaces all data in a backup in the data management service

==== Single backup type
All agents belong to a backup manager, currently this is a one to one map with backup type. By supporting a single backup type a DM can be identified for a
backup or restore operation independently or in groups of services that are a subset of all active agents.
Note: All agents are registered to the DEFAULT backup manager to ensure it is always possible to perform backup and restore actions.

==== Agent Discovery
To complement agents registering with the orchestrator, agents have labels and annotations in the charts to indicate they are to be considered in a backup. This is to allow
for a way to check that all agents are connected and active before taking action.
NOTE: This is only needed for backup, for restore a list of agents is read from the backup and all must be present.

==== Pre Restore
An agent can provide a set of instructions which will be executed before the restore action. All agents will be asked to perform this operation,
by default the agent will automatically respond to this operation with a success message. The next operation will not proceed until all agents have responded.

==== Post Restore
An agent can provide a set of instructions which will be executed after the restore action. All agents will be asked to perform this operation,
by default the agent will automatically respond to this operation with a success message. The next operation will not proceed until all agents have responded.

==== Multiple backup type
An agent can register with multiple backup types. Only a single type will be triggered at a time. This allows for multiple types of backups/restores to be taken and will
be used in combination with selective backup.

==== Selective backup
An agent can be configured to include only parts of a Data Management services' data, for example an individual logical database or table.
