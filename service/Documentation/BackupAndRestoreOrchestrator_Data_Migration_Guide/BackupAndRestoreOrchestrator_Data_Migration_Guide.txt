== Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to show how to import backups from a R1 BRO
into a R2 BRO, with examples.

The guide does not cover in detail the complete BRO deployment. For more
details, refer to the Backup and Restore Orchestrator Deployment Guide
(see <<Deployment,Backup and Restore Orchestrator Deployment Guide>>).

== Prerequisites

* A running R1 BRO with a backup to be exported.
* A running SFTP server, to hold the exported backup.

== Export required Backups

A R1 BRO comes with a SFTP server that holds all backup data and details.
In order to export a backup, it is necessary to access that SFTP server and get those files.

The following files must be exported:

* The JSON file containing backup details.
* The entire folder where the backup data resides.

=== Exporting Backup JSON file

The JSON file is named `<backupName>.json` and it's located at `<backup.managers.location>/<backupManagerId>/backups`.

`backup.managers.location` is a BRO property that indicates where to store its own metadata.

If that property were set to `/bro` and the backup to be exported was called `myBackup`,
belonging to the `configuration` backupManager, it would be necessary to get the file
`/bro/configuration/backups/myBackup.json`.

=== Exporting Backup Data

The folder containing all of the backup's data is located at `<backup.location>/<backupManagerId>/<backupName>`

`backup.location` is a BRO property that indicates where to store backup data.

If that property were set to `/backup-data` and the backup to be exported was called `myBackup`,
belonging to the `configuration` backupManager, it would be necessary to get the folder
`/backup-data/configuration/myBackup/`.

== Tear Down R1 BRO

Uninstall the R1 BRO, which will also remove the SFTP server that was used to export the backup.

== Install R2 BRO

Follow the Deployment Guide to install the latest version of BRO.
See <<Deployment,Backup and Restore Orchestrator Deployment Guide>>.

== Install Agents

Install all agents involved in the exported backup(s).
They are needed to create all the necessary Backup Managers and
to perform restores.

== Prepare Backup to be imported

In order to import a backup into a R2 BRO, it is necessary to place the exported
files in a remote SFTP server, following a different folder structure.

* Create the folders to hold all backup files. The root folder will be referred to as `rootSftpFolder`.
* Place the JSON file at `<rootSftpFolder>/<backupManagerId>/<backupName>/backupfile/`.
* Place the backup data folder at `<rootSftpFolder>/<backupManagerId>/<backupName>/backupdata/`.

To import the `myBackup` backup, belonging to `configuration` backupManager,
using `/bro/export/` as `rootSftpFolder`, it would be necessary to:

* Create the folder `/bro/export/configuration/myBackup/backupfile/`
* Place `myBackup.json` at `/bro/export/configuration/myBackup/backupfile/myBackup.json`.
* Create the folder `/bro/export/configuration/myBackup/backupdata/`
* Place `myBackup` folder at `/bro/export/configuration/myBackup/backupdata/myBackup`.

To further clarify, the folder structure in the SFTP server would be:

....
/bro
+-- export
    +-- configuration
        +-- myBackup
            |-- backupdata
            |   +-- myBackup
            |       +-- ...
            +-- backupfile
                +-- myBackup.json
....

== Importing a Backup

Verify if the Backup Manager that owns the Backup exists in the R2 BRO.

Execute an import pointing to the backup folder in the SFTP server.

Using the backup from the previous section as example, the folder would be
`/bro/export/configuration/myBackup`.

For specific details on how to verify if the Backup Manager exists and
how to import a backup to a R2 BRO, refer to:

* Backup and Restore Orchestrator Operations Guide, to interact with the BRO using Rest.
  See <<Operations,Backup and Restore Orchestrator Operations Guide>>.
* Backup and Restore Orchestrator Operations Guide CMYP, to interact with the BRO through CMYP.
  See <<OperationsCMYP,Backup and Restore Orchestrator Operations Guide CMYP>>.
