== Overview

This document provides an overview of the Backup and Restore Orchestrator.

It gives a brief description of its main features and its interfaces.

=== Description of the Service

The primary goal of the Backup and Restore Orchestrator service is to provide a consistent set of API's for backup and restore operations orchestration across multiple services.

This is achieved via communication between the Backup and Restore Orchestrator component and one or more application-specific Agents.

=== Purpose

To enable backup and restore, for an Ericsson application, within a Microservices environment.

=== Main Concepts

The major concepts in the Backup and Restore Orchestrator are:

==== Backup

Set of data for a service, stored remotely. It represents the state those services had at the time it was created, and can be used to recreate that state.

==== Restore

Copy data from a backup to recreate the state the affected services had at the time when the backup was created.

==== Agent

Part of a service that is used to integrate that service into the ADP backup and restore solution. It communicates with the BR Orchestrator, and has logic specific to the service it is bundled with to create and restore backups.

==== Fragment

A piece of the backup that is uploaded by an Agent to the Orchestrator during a backup operation or downloaded from the Orchestrator during a restore operation. Each backup consists of one or more backup fragments per agent.

==== Backup Type

Each agent can register as belonging to zero or more backup types. A backup type defines a set of agents, this allows for a backup to be taken of a subset of services.

=== Features

The Backup and Restore Orchestrator has a number of optional features.

==== Notification

The Orchestrator pushes a notification message to a Message Bus KF topic every time a backup or a restore has started, completed or failed, indicating the status of the action.

A notification message example is:

....
{ "version": "1.0.0", "action": "RESTORE", "actionId":"7643", "backupManagerId":"DEFAULT", "status": "STARTED"}
....

|===
|Field | Description | values

|`version` |Indicates the version of the BR_INTERNAL_NOTIFICATION API that the notification adheres to| <BR_INTERNAL_NOTIFICATION_VERSION>
|`action` |Indicates the action which published the notification| `CREATE_BACKUP`, `RESTORE`
|`actionId`|Indicates the action's ID |<RANDOMLY_GENERATED_ID>
|`backupManagerId`|Indicates the ID of the Backup Manager responsible for the action |<ID_OF_BACKUP_MANAGER>
|`status`|Indicates the notification status |`STARTED`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`
|===


==== Agent Discovery

The Orchestrator will use the Kubernetes API to find all Agents expected to participate in a backup. If the registered Agents do not match the expected agents, the backup will fail.


==== Configuration Management

The Orchestrator will push its metadata to a running instance of CM Mediator. Backup and Restore Operations can then be initiated using the CM Yang Provider service.
For more details, see the <<CMYPOperationsGuide, Backup and Restore Operations Guide for CM Yang Provider>>.

==== Immediate Deletion of Failed Backups

The Orchestrator will automatically delete backups which are the result of a failed `CREATE_BACKUP` action. Disabled by default, please see the <<ServiceUserGuide, Service User Guide>>.

==== Log Streaming

The Orchestrator can stream log events to the Log Transformer, in the syslog format specified in RFC 5424. Disabled by default, please see the <<ServiceUserGuide, Service User Guide>>.

== API

The URI resources in the Backup and Restore Orchestrator REST interface can be accessed using the major version.

E.g. "http://<ipaddress>:7001/v1/backup-manager/<backupManagerId>"

For more details, see the <<OperationsGuide, Operations Guide>>.

== Architecture

The following picture shows the Backup and Restore Orchestrator and its architectural context:

Backup and Restore Orchestrator provided interfaces:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| Interface Logical Name
| Description

| INT.BR.ORCH.CTRL
| This interface is used for control and coordination messages / events between the BR Orchestrator and Agents.

| INT.BR.ORCH.DATA
| This interface is used for two-way data transfer between the BR Orchestrator and Agents during the Backup and Restore use cases.
|===

== Deployment

Backup and Restore Orchestrator is packaged as a Docker container. It supports deployment in Kubernetes using Helm.

The Backup and Restore Orchestrator supports only singular replication e.g. one instance of the service.

To deploy the Service, refer to the Deployment section of the Service User Guide (see <<ServiceUserGuide, Service User Guide>>). This guide:

* Explains how to get started using the Backup and Restore Orchestrator in the supported environments.
* Specifies configuration options for starting the Backup and Restore Orchestrator service.

If problems occur when using the service, refer to the Troubleshooting section of the Service User Guide (see <<ServiceUserGuide, Service User Guide>>).

== Dimensioning and Characteristics

=== Dimensioning
To handle dimensioning configuration at deployment time, refer to the <<Deployment, Deployment Guide>>.

////
=== Resilience
[red]#<TODO: Describe from a functional view how it is designed to support resilience. How does the service achieve high availability>#
////

=== Upgrade - In Service Software Upgrade

Backup and Restore is a single instance service that is robust and can maintain state between restarts.
During an upgrade the service will be unavailable for a short period of time.
Upgrade should be performed when there are no ongoing backup and/or restore actions in progress or planned for the near future.
